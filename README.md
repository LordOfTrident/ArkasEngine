# Arkas Engine
WIP (literally started today) 3D engine with build-like maps

This current version is a rushed tech demo with no portals and just 1 sector. So,
not a game engine yet. Also that's why the code is terrible so don't judge

Controls:
- WASD for movement
- left or right arrow keys to turn camera (or use mouse)
- O to free the cursor
- P to lock the cursor back into the window

## Build
```
make
```
Requires SDL2 and stb (clone recursively!)

## Graphics backends
### Implemented
- OpenGL 1.1

### Todo
- OpenGL 1.5 (for VBO)
- OpenGL 2.0 (for shaders)
